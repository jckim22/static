            <h2>WEB</h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling documents and
                other web
                resources to be accessed over the Internet.[1]

                Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be
                accessed by
                programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located
                through
                character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still very common document
                type is a
                web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text,
                images,
                embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction.
                The
                HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web
                resources.
                Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple
                websites.
                Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is
                transferred
                across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

                Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single
                web
                server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be
                provided by
                multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government
                agencies, and
                individual users; and comprises an enormous mass of educational, entertainment, commercial, and
                government
                information.

                The World Wide Web has become the world's dominant software platform.[2][3][4][5] It is the primary tool
                billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.[6]
