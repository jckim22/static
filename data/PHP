<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>is a general-purpose scripting language geared
                    toward web development.[5] It was
                    originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[6] The PHP reference
                    implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[7] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[6]
                    but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[8]

                    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon
                    or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted
                    and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data –
                    would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content
                    management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the
                    generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the
                    web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9] and robotic drone control.[10] PHP code
                    can also be directly executed from the command line.

                    The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP
                    License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of
                    operating systems and platforms.[11]

                    The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the
                    original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow.
                    Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.[12]

                    W3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, "PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose
                    server-side programming language we know."[13] PHP version 7.4 is the most used version. Support for
                    version 7.3 was dropped on 6 December 2021.</p>
